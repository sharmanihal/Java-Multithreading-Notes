### Scope of Lock:
**1. Synchronized Block/Method:** If you use a synchronized block or method, the lock is tied to the object (this if non-static) or the class (if static) on which it's applied. This means any other synchronized method/block that uses the same lock will be affected.

**2. Explicit Lock (Lock interface):** If you're using Lock from java.util.concurrent.locks, you have more control. The lock is acquired when you call lock() and is released when you call unlock(). You can use this lock across multiple methods or even across different objects.When using Lock from java.util.concurrent.locks, the code between the lock() and unlock() calls is what gets synchronized. The lock is held from the moment lock() is called until unlock() is called, ensuring that no other thread can execute the locked section simultaneously.

### Fairness of locks:
To understand the concept of fairness of locks, let's take an example.

Suppose, we have a class with this code inside it -
```
public class FairnessExample {

    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void accessResource() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the lock!");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " released the lock!");
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

So, we have a simple "Reentrant" lock in this class and a method named "accessResource". We first acquire a lock, then we print that the thread acquired the lock and then we wait for 1 second. Then in finally, we release t he lock and print that the Thread released the lock.

So, if we have a main method like this -
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    FairnessExample unfairLockExample = new FairnessExample();
    Runnable task = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            unfairLockExample.accessResource();
        }
    };

    Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread 1");
    Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread 2");
    Thread t3 = new Thread(task, "Thread 3");
    Thread t4 = new Thread(task, "Thread 4");
    Thread t5 = new Thread(task, "Thread 5");

    t1.start();
    t2.start();
    t3.start();
    t4.start();
    t5.start();
}
```

You will see that when you run this code again and again, the printed values in the terminal won't always be in the same order. Sometimes thread 3 will acquire the lock before thread 2 and somtimes thread 4 will acquire the lock before thread 3 and so on.

And here comes the concept of "Fairness" of locks. "Fairness" basically means in what order the Threads will acquire the lock.

The fairness of locks refers to the property of a locking mechanism that ensures that all threads or processes that are trying to acquire a lock will eventually get it in a fair manner, preventing starvation and ensuring a more predictable order of access.

A fair lock guarantees that every thread will eventually acquire the lock, and it does not allow any thread to be starved indefinitely. This is important in multi-threaded environments where threads compete for shared resources.

Fair locks typically use a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue to manage the order in which threads are granted access to the lock. This ensures that the thread that has been waiting the longest gets the lock next.

While fair locks prevent starvation, they may introduce overhead and reduce performance due to the need to manage the queue and potentially increase context switching. Non-fair locks, which do not guarantee order, might provide better performance in some scenarios but can lead to starvation.

Fair locks are particularly useful in scenarios where fairness is critical, such as in resource management systems or user interface applications, where it is essential to ensure responsiveness and avoid locking out certain operations for extended periods.


### USING THE "fair" PROPERTY OF REENTRANT LOCKS
The "ReentrantLock" class has this constructor -
```
public ReentrantLock(boolean fair) {
    sync = fair ? new FairSync() : new NonfairSync();
}
```
This will create a new instance of "ReentrantLock" class with a "fairness" policy.

It takes a "boolean" which means we pass it true or false. "True" means lock should use a Fair ordering policy, meaning that whatever Thread requested for the lock first, give the lock to that Thread first.

So, in our code, we can write -

private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(true);
Now, you will see that when we run the code again, we do not get the values printed in this order -> 1,2,3,4,5

Sometimes Thread 1 is the first to get a lock, sometimes it is Thread 3 and so on.

Does it mean Fairness is not working?

Well, remember that we said "Whatever Threads requested for the lock first, give the lock to that Thread". So, just because we have this code -
```
t1.start();
t2.start();
t3.start();
t4.start();
t5.start();
```
This doesn't mean always the thread that will be the first to request a lock will be Thread t1 only and then t2 and then t3 and so on.

All this depends on the Thread Scheduler in the Operating System. The operating system's thread scheduler determines when each thread is given CPU time. Even if "t1" is started first, the scheduler might not immediately allocate CPU time to it.

Once started, threads may run in a non-deterministic order. Depending on system load and other threads' execution times, t2, t3, t4, or t5 might be scheduled before t1.

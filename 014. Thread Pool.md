### Thread Pool:
Thread Pooling in Java is a technique where a collection of reusable threads is maintained for executing tasks, allowing the system to efficiently handle a large number of requests without constantly creating and destroying threads.

This helps to manage system resources more effectively by reusing a pool of threads rather than creating a new thread for every task.

**BENEFITS**

- Performance: Reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction, especially when handling multiple short-lived tasks.

- Resource Management: Helps in managing the number of concurrent threads and preventing system overload by limiting the maximum number of threads.

- Efficiency: Allows tasks to be processed concurrently while minimizing the resource consumption of creating and managing threads.

**HOW DOES IT WORK?**

- A fixed number of threads are created and stored in a pool.

- Tasks are submitted to the pool and wait for an available thread to execute them.

- Once a task is completed, the thread is returned to the pool and can be reused for new tasks.

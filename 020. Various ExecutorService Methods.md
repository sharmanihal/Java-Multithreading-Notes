### 1. <T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result):

The method <T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result) in the ExecutorService interface is used to submit a Runnable task for execution and receive a Future representing the result. The specified result is returned upon successful completion of the task.

Key Points:
1. Runnable Task: The task to be executed.

2. Result: The result that will be returned by the Future upon successful completion of the task.

Example:
Here's how you might use this method:
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println("Executing Task");
            // Perform some task
        };

        Future<String> future = executor.submit(task, "Task Completed");

        // Wait for the task to complete and get the result
        String result = future.get();
        System.out.println(result);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
What Happens Here:
1. A fixed thread pool with 3 threads is created.

2. A Runnable task is defined to print "Executing Task".

3. The task is submitted to the executor with a specified result "Task Completed".

4. The Future returned by submit will provide the specified result once the task completes.

5. The result is retrieved using future.get() and printed.

This approach ensures you get a predefined result upon completion, allowing you to focus on the core logic without worrying about managing task execution details. 

### 2. boolean isShutdown():


The isShutdown() method in ExecutorService returns true if the executor has been shut down, and false otherwise. It helps check if the executor has been ordered to shut down but may still be executing tasks.
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ShutdownExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit some tasks
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        // Shut down the executor
        executor.shutdown();

        // Check if the executor is shut down
        if (executor.isShutdown()) {
            System.out.println("Executor has been shut down.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Executor is still running.");
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Submit some tasks for execution.

Shut down the executor using shutdown().

Check if the executor is shut down using isShutdown() and print the result.

Super handy to know if things are wrapping up as expected, right?
```

### 3. boolean isTerminated();
The isTerminated() method in ExecutorService checks whether all tasks have completed following a shutdown. It returns true if the executor has terminated, meaning all tasks are done executing after the shutdown request.

Example:
```
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class TerminatedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit some tasks
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        // Shut down the executor
        executor.shutdown();

        // Check if all tasks are completed and executor is terminated
        if (executor.isTerminated()) {
            System.out.println("Executor has terminated.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Executor is still running or tasks are not completed.");
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Submit tasks for execution.

Shut down the executor using shutdown().

Check if the executor is terminated using isTerminated() and print the result.

Ensures you know when the work's all wrapped up and done, no loose ends. Make sense?
```



### 4. <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException;

This method, <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException, in the ExecutorService interface is used to execute a collection of Callable tasks. It returns a list of Future objects holding the results of the tasks when all complete.

How it Works:
1. Collection of Callables: A collection of tasks that return a result and may throw an exception.
2. Future List: A list of Future objects representing the results of all tasks.

Example:
```
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class InvokeAllExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        List<Callable<Integer>> tasks = Arrays.asList(
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                return 1;
            },
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                return 2;
            },
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
                return 3;
            }
        );

        try {
            List<Future<Integer>> futures = executor.invokeAll(tasks);

            for (Future<Integer> future : futures) {
                System.out.println("Result: " + future.get());
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Executor: Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Tasks: Define a collection of Callable tasks.

invokeAll: Submit the tasks to the executor.

Results: Wait for all tasks to complete and retrieve the results.

Neat way to handle multiple tasks in parallel while keeping things organized, right?
```
**invokeAll with timeout**
Let's add a timeout to the invokeAll method. With a timeout, if the tasks do not complete within the specified time, they will be terminated, and the method will return. Here's how to do it:

### 5. <T> T invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException;

The invokeAny method in ExecutorService executes the given collection of tasks and returns the result of one that has completed successfully (i.e., without throwing an exception), if any do. This method blocks until at least one task completes successfully or the calling thread is interrupted. If no task completes successfully, it throws an ExecutionException.

Example:
```
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class InvokeAnyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        List<Callable<Integer>> tasks = Arrays.asList(
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                return 1;
            },
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                return 2;
            },
            () -> {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
                return 3;
            }
        );

        try {
            Integer result = executor.invokeAny(tasks);
            System.out.println("First completed result: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Executor: Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Tasks: Define a collection of Callable tasks.

invokeAny: Submit the tasks and get the result of the first completed task.

Result: Print the result of the first successfully completed task.

A nifty way to get the quickest successful result out of several tasks! What do you think?
```

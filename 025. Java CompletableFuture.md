### CompletableFuture
A CompletableFuture in Java is a tool that helps you write asynchronous code, allowing tasks to run in the background without blocking the main thread. Think of it as a way to perform tasks like downloading a file, fetching data from a server, or performing a long calculation without making your program freeze while waiting for the result.

**Simple Explanation with a Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine you order a pizza. While waiting for the pizza to be delivered, you donâ€™t just stand by the door doing nothing; instead, you watch TV or do some other activities. When the pizza arrives, you get notified (a doorbell rings), and you can then stop what you're doing and start enjoying your pizza.

**In programming terms:**
```
Ordering the pizza is like starting a background task.

Watching TV or doing other activities represents other tasks that your program can continue doing while waiting for the background task to finish.

The doorbell ringing is like the notification that your background task is complete, and now you can process the result.
```


**CompletableFuture in Java**

A CompletableFuture is a special class that helps you manage tasks that are running in the background (asynchronously). It lets you set up what to do when the task completes, like executing some code once the result is available.

Commonly Used Methods with Examples

Let's go over some of the most commonly used methods of CompletableFuture with simple examples:
1. **CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(): This method is used to start an asynchronous task that returns a result.**
```
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // Simulate a long-running task
    try {
        Thread.sleep(2000); // sleep for 2 seconds
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return "Pizza is ready!";
});

System.out.println("Order placed, waiting for the pizza...");

// Wait for the result
String result = future.join(); // This blocks the main thread until the future is completed
System.out.println(result);
```

**Explanation:**

- Here, supplyAsync starts a background task that simulates making a pizza.

- While the pizza is being prepared, the main program can continue doing other things.

- The join() method waits for the result (blocks the main thread) and then prints the message when the pizza is ready.



2. **thenApply(): Used to process the result of a CompletableFuture once it's complete.**
```
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 10);
CompletableFuture<Integer> resultFuture = future.thenApply(number -> number * 2);

System.out.println("The result is: " + resultFuture.join());
```
**Explanation:**

- supplyAsync returns 10, and thenApply takes that value and multiplies it by 2.

- The final result is printed as 20.



3. **thenAccept(): Similar to thenApply(), but it doesn't return a value. It just performs an action with the result.**
```
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello, World!")
        .thenAccept(message -> System.out.println("Message received: " + message));
future.join();
```
**Explanation:**

- This example asynchronously creates a message and then prints it once it's available.

- thenAccept processes the result, but since it's a Void method, it doesn't return anything.



4. **thenCombine(): Combines the results of two CompletableFutures.**
```
CompletableFuture<Integer> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 20);
CompletableFuture<Integer> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 30);

CompletableFuture<Integer> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, Integer::sum);
System.out.println("The combined result is: " + combinedFuture.join());
```
**Explanation:**

- Two asynchronous tasks are run, one returning 20 and the other returning 30.

- thenCombine adds their results together, giving a combined result of 50.



5. **exceptionally(): Provides a way to handle exceptions if the CompletableFuture fails.**
```
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if (true) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!");
    }
    return 42;
}).exceptionally(ex -> {
    System.out.println("Caught exception: " + ex.getMessage());
    return -1; // Fallback value
});

System.out.println("The result is: " + future.join());
```
**Explanation:**

- The code simulates an error occurring during the task.

- exceptionally provides a way to handle the exception and return a fallback value of -1.




**Summary of Common Methods**

supplyAsync(): Starts an asynchronous task that returns a result.

thenApply(): Processes the result of a CompletableFuture and returns a new result.

thenAccept(): Consumes the result of a CompletableFuture but does not return a new result.

thenCombine(): Combines the results of two CompletableFutures.

exceptionally(): Handles exceptions and provides a fallback value.


### Some More Methods:
The methods .get(), .join(), and .getNow() are used to retrieve the result of a CompletableFuture in Java. Here's an explanation of each, along with examples and differences:

1. **.get()**

**Description**: The .get() method is used to wait for the CompletableFuture to complete and then retrieve its result. It blocks the calling thread until the future is completed, which means it will make the thread wait until the result is available.

**Usage**: It can throw two types of exceptions: InterruptedException (if the current thread was interrupted while waiting) and ExecutionException (if the computation threw an exception).


Example:
```
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate a long-running task
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return "Task Completed";
});

try {
    String result = future.get(); // This will block until the task is complete
    System.out.println(result);   // Output: Task Completed (after 2 seconds)
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
**Explanation:**

- The .get() method waits for the asynchronous task to finish, blocking the current thread for 2 seconds.

- When the task completes, it returns the result "Task Completed".


2. **.join()**

**Description**: The .join() method is similar to .get(), but it throws an unchecked CompletionException if the computation threw an exception, rather than checked exceptions (InterruptedException and ExecutionException).

**Usage**: It is useful when you prefer not to handle checked exceptions explicitly.


Example:
```
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate a long-running task
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return "Task Completed";
});

String result = future.join(); // This will block until the task is complete
System.out.println(result);    // Output: Task Completed (after 2 seconds)
```
**Explanation**:

- The .join() method works similarly to .get(), but it doesn't require you to catch checked exceptions.

- It will still block the calling thread until the task completes.


3. **.getNow()**

**Description**: The .getNow() method retrieves the result of the CompletableFuture if it has already completed. If the future is not complete yet, it returns the provided default value instead. It does not block the calling thread.

**Usage**: It is helpful when you want to get the result only if it's immediately available, without waiting for the task to complete.


Example:
```
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate a long-running task
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return "Task Completed";
});

String result = future.getNow("Not Completed Yet"); // Will return "Not Completed Yet" immediately
System.out.println(result);  // Output: Not Completed Yet (because the task takes 2 seconds)
```
**Explanation**:

- Since the asynchronous task takes 2 seconds to complete, the .getNow("Not Completed Yet") method immediately returns "Not Completed Yet" because the future isn't complete yet.

- After 2 seconds, if you call .getNow() again, it would return "Task Completed".


**Summary of Differences**

When to Use Each Method

Use .get() when you need to block the current thread until the CompletableFuture completes and want to handle checked exceptions explicitly.

Use .join() if you prefer not to handle checked exceptions and want to simplify the code.

Use .getNow() when you want to get the result only if it's available without waiting, and you are fine with a default value if the computation is still in progress.


These methods help control the flow when working with asynchronous programming, allowing you to decide whether to block the calling thread, handle exceptions, or use default values.

**Conclusion**

CompletableFuture is a powerful tool for writing non-blocking, asynchronous code in Java. It allows tasks to run in the background while the main program continues to execute, and it provides various methods to handle results and exceptions gracefully.

### Executor Framework:
The "Executors Framework" was introduced back in Java 5 as part of the "java.util.concurrent" package to simplify the development of concurrent applications by abstracting away many of the complexities involved in creating and managing the threads.

So, what were the problems that developers were facing prior to the Executors Framework?

### PROBLEMS DEVELOPERS FACED WITHOUT EXECUTORS FRAMEWORK
- **Manual Thread Management -** Managing threads manually is complex and error-prone. Developers need to manually create, start, and manage the lifecycle of each thread, leading to potential issues like resource leaks, difficulty in scaling, and incorrect usage of threads.
- **Resource Inefficiency (Thread Overhead) -** Creating a new thread for every task can lead to significant overhead, especially in applications with many short-lived tasks. Starting and stopping threads consumes system resources, which can degrade performance.
- **Thread Explosion (Too Many Threads) -** Without proper thread management, creating too many threads can exhaust system resources, leading to performance bottlenecks or crashes.
- **Uncoordinated Task Execution -** When working with multiple threads, coordinating and executing tasks sequentially or periodically becomes challenging, leading to race conditions, missed schedules, or incorrect execution.
- **Lack of Task Feedback -** When using traditional threads, there’s no easy way to get the result of a task or check its completion status.
- **Difficult Shutdown of Threads -** Manually shutting down threads is difficult and error-prone, often leading to either abrupt termination (causing data corruption) or leaving threads running indefinitely (memory leaks).
- **Lack of Parallel Task Execution Support -** Executing multiple independent tasks in parallel can be difficult to manage, especially when tasks need to return results or need to be executed asynchronously in batches.
- **Error Handling in Threads -** Handling exceptions in traditional threads can be tricky, as uncaught exceptions in one thread don’t affect the other threads or the main program flow, potentially leaving errors unnoticed.

### Finding Faconacii Sequence using Traditional Threads Method: 

```
public class Factorial {

    public static int findFactorial(int i){
        if (i==1){
            return 1;
        }
        if (i==0){
            return 0;
        }
        return i*findFactorial(i-1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int finalI = i;
            threads[i]= new Thread(()->{
                System.out.println(findFactorial(finalI));
            });
            threads[i].start();
        }
        for (Thread thread : threads){
            try {
                thread.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }

    }
}
```

When dealing with tasks like finding the Fibonacci sequence, traditional methods involve creating, managing, and starting threads manually. This can be cumbersome and error-prone:

1. Creating the threads.
2. Managing the threads.
3. Starting the threads.

Wouldn't it be better if we could simply specify the number of threads we need and let Java handle the rest? That's where the Executor Framework shines.

**Key Benefits of the Executor Framework:**
1. Task Submission: Submit tasks for execution without worrying about thread management.
2. Thread Management: Automatically handle thread creation, management, and termination.
3. Resource Optimization: Efficiently use system resources by reusing threads.

### CORE INTERFACES IN THE EXECUTORS FRAMEWORK


There are three core interfaces in the Executors Framework.

1. **Executor Interface -** This is the root interface that provides one method to execute the tasks "asynchronously". This is how it is defined in Java -
```
 public interface Executor {
     void execute(Runnable command);
 }
```

2. **ExecutorService Interface -** This interface "extends" the "Executor" interface and this one has more methods to manage the lifecycle of the tasks and thread pools. It provides more control over task execution, including the ability to retrieve results, monitor task status, and shut down the thread pool.

This is how it is defined in Java -
```
public interface ExecutorService extends Executor, AutoCloseable {

    void shutdown();

    List<Runnable> shutdownNow();

    boolean isShutdown();

    boolean isTerminated();

    boolean awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException;

    <T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);

    <T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);

    Future<?> submit(Runnable task);

    <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException;

    <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException;

    <T> T invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException;

    <T> T invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException;
    
    @Override
    default void close() {...}
}
```

3. **ScheduledExecutorService Interface -** The third interface that we have in the Executors Framework is the "ScheduledExecutorService" interface which extends the "ExecutorService" interface. This interface provides methods to schedule tasks to run after a delay or at fixed intervals. It is useful for periodic or delayed task execution, such as monitoring tasks, recurring background jobs, or tasks that should start after a delay.
```
public interface ScheduledExecutorService extends ExecutorService {

 public ScheduledFuture<?> schedule(Runnable command, long delay, TimeUnit unit);

 
 public <V> ScheduledFuture<V> schedule(Callable<V> callable, long delay, TimeUnit unit);

 
 public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit);

 
 public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command,long initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit);
}
```

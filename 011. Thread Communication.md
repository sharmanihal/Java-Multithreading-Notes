### Thread Communication in Multithreading
In a multithreaded environment, threads often need to communicate and coordinate to achieve a common goal. Without a proper communication mechanism, threads might end up in busy-waiting states, leading to CPU wastage and potential deadlocks.

**Producer-Consumer Example:**

Consider the classic "Producer-Consumer" problem:

1. Producer Thread: Produces data that the consumer thread needs to process.

2. Consumer Thread: Consumes the produced data.

**Without proper communication:**

1. The consumer might attempt to consume data before it's produced.

2. The producer needs to inform the consumer when new data is available.

3. The consumer needs to signal when itâ€™s ready for more data.

Without these signals, the consumer might continuously check for new data, wasting CPU resources.

**Avoiding Race Conditions:**

Race conditions happen when multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously without synchronization. This can lead to inconsistent and incorrect data states.

Example: Banking System

1. Multiple threads update account balances.

2. Without proper communication, threads might overwrite each other's updates.

3. Synchronization ensures each balance update is consistent and correct.

**Coordination and Dependencies:**
Threads often depend on the completion or results of other threads. Communication allows one thread to notify another when its task is complete, ensuring dependent threads proceed at the right time.

Example: Background Task

1. A background task processes data and needs to inform the main thread when done.

2. The main thread can then update the user interface based on the processed data.

### Interthread Communication Methods:
There are methods in the "Object" class that are used for communication between the threads and these are -
Note: These methods can only be called in a synchronized context and block.
- wait()
- notify()
- notifyAll()

### wait() Method:

The wait() method in Java is used for inter-thread communication. When a thread calls wait(), it releases the lock it's holding and enters a waiting state until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object. This is typically used to coordinate activities between multiple threads.
Once the thread is notified (or interrupted), it does not resume execution immediately but must wait until it can reacquire the lock for the object.

When a thread calls wait(), it releases the lock it holds and enters the waiting state. Another thread must signal it with notify() or notifyAll() after some condition is met.

### notify() METHOD
The "notify()" method wakes up one of the threads that is waiting on the object's monitor (lock). If multiple threads are waiting, it is up to the JVM to decide which one gets notified.

The notified thread remains in the waiting state until it can reacquire the lock on the object.

### notifyAll() method
The "notifyAll()" method wakes up all the threads that are waiting on the object's monitor. All the waiting threads will move from the waiting state to a runnable state, but they still need to reacquire the lock one at a time.

This is generally used when multiple threads are waiting for a condition to be fulfilled, and notifying all of them is safe.


### Example:

Let's take the same producer-consumer problem.

Let's say we have a class named "SharedResource" that has a "data" and a boolean flag named "hasData" that indicates if there is data for the consumer to consume. And we have two methods "produce" and "consume". One will produce some data and the other consumes it.
```
class SharedResource {

    private int data;

    private boolean hasData;

    public void produce(int value){
    }

    public int consume(){
    }
}
```
Now, we only want to "produce" data if no data is left to consume. That is, if "hasData" is false. This means, if hasData is true, we want to wait till it becomes false.


```
public synchronized void produce(int value){
        //If we already have data in the buffer
        while (hasData) {
            try {
                wait();//Since we already have data in the buffer wait some more to produce data.
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
        //If we don't have data in the buffer
        data=value;
        hasData=true;
        System.out.println("Produced "+ data);
        //Notify other waiting thread that the data is now available
        notify();
        //The lock is held till this point i.e, till the method is over
    }
```

So here, if there is data, then "hasData" will be true. So, we want the Thread to release any lock it has on this SharedResource instance and wait till some other thread calls "notify" or "notifyAll".

But, if there is no data, then set the "data" field to the passed value and then set the "hasData" flag to "true". Finally, also make sure to call "notify()" so that if there are threads that are waiting to consume data but cannot do it because "hasData" was false so far, then they start consuming it now.

Similarly, we only want to "consume" data if there is data to consume. That is, if the "hasData" is true. Otherwise, we want to wait till "hasData" becomes true.


```
public synchronized void consume(){
        //If we don't have data to consume then wait
        while(!hasData){
            try{
                wait();//Since we don't have any data in the buffer wait some more to consume the data.
            }catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
        //If we have data to consume
        System.out.println("Consumed "+ data);
        hasData=false;
        notify();// notify waiting thread that the data is consumed
        //The lock is held till this point i.e, till the method is over
    }
```

Here also, the same story. The only difference is, in this case, we will wait if there is no data. And only if data is available, we wil return it and notify() the ProducerThread that we are done consuming and hence "hasData" is set to "false" again.

Note that both these are "synchronized" methods because as we know, "wait()" and "notify()" can only be used in "synchronized" context.

And now, the rest of the code is pretty simple. We can create two "Runnable" classes, one for "produce" and one for "consume".


```
class Producer implements Runnable{

    private SharedResource resource;
    Producer(SharedResource resource){
        this.resource=resource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        //Procure some data of shared resource
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            resource.produce(i);
        }
    }
}

class Consumer implements Runnable{
    private SharedResource resource;
    Consumer(SharedResource resource){
        this.resource=resource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            resource.consume();
        }
    }
}
```

And this is our main method -
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

    Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(resource));
    Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(resource));

    producerThread.start();
    consumerThread.start();
}
```

And the output will be -
```
Produced: 0
Consumed: 0
Produced: 1
Consumed: 1
Produced: 2
Consumed: 2
Produced: 3
Consumed: 3
Produced: 4
Consumed: 4
Produced: 5
Consumed: 5
Produced: 6
Consumed: 6
Produced: 7
Consumed: 7
Produced: 8
Consumed: 8
Produced: 9
Consumed: 9
```
So, the summary is -

- wait(): Puts the calling thread into a waiting state, releasing the lock.

- notify(): Wakes up one waiting thread, which must reacquire the lock before proceeding.

- notifyAll(): Wakes up all waiting threads, but only one can proceed at a time, depending on lock availability.

These methods are crucial for ensuring proper coordination in multithreaded Java applications.

If we had multiple consumers, then we could use notifyAll() so as to wake up all those waiting consumer threads.

What would happen if we hadn't used wait() or notify()?

Without "wait()", if the producer tries to produce when the resource is already available (or the consumer tries to consume when it's not available), both threads will keep looping endlessly, checking the available condition. This results in busy waiting.

The threads will constantly check the condition without releasing the CPU, leading to inefficient resource usage and potential performance degradation.

In the absence of "wait()" and "notify()", there is no proper synchronization between the producer and consumer threads. Both may try to access or modify the shared available variable at the same time.

For instance, the producer might produce a resource while the consumer is also trying to consume it, leading to a race condition. This can cause unpredictable and inconsistent results.

Without "notify()", even if one thread completes its work (i.e., the producer has produced a resource), the other thread (the consumer) will not be notified to proceed. This could lead to thread starvation, where one thread is stuck indefinitely waiting for an event that never happens.

There is also a potential for deadlock if both threads end up waiting for a resource or condition that never changes, leading to a halt in program execution.

### Read and Write Locks:

When we use "synchronized" keyword, it cannot distinguish between "Read" and "Write" operation so there is some unnecessary blocking.

Any synchronized method can be accessed by one thread at a time, regardless of whether it's performing a read or a write operation.

As we knew in the previous sections, apart from "ReentrantLock", there is also something called "ReentrantReadWriteLock". This is an implementation of the "ReadWriteLock" interface.

The "ReadWriteLock" interface is like this -
```
public interface ReadWriteLock {
    Lock readLock();
    Lock writeLock();
}
```

So, this interface has two methods, one named "readLock", the other named "writeLock". One returns a Lock that is used for "Read" operations and the other returns a lock that is used for "Write" operations.

"ReadWriteLock" allows multiple threads to read the resources concurrently as long as no thread is writing to it. It ensures exclusive access for write operation.

Let's take an example to understand this.

Suppose, we have a class with a "count" variable and these two methods in it -
```
public class ReadWriteCounter {

    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCounter() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

So, the "increment" method will update the value of the "count" variable which means it is a "write" operation. And the "getCount" will simply return the value of count so it is a "read" operation.

Now, what we want is, multiple threads can read simultaneously if they call the "getCount". We should not block them. But, only one should be able to "write" or "increment" the count value at a time.

And here, we can use the "ReadWriteLock" interface and its "ReentrantReadWriteLock" implementation.


```
public class ReadWriteCounter {

    private int count = 0;

    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    private final Lock readLock = lock.readLock();

    private final Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();

    public void increment() {
        writeLock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            writeLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCounter() {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

So now, we introduced a new field named "lock" which is a new "ReentrantReadWriteLock". And as we saw, we have two methods provided to us by "ReadWriteLock" interface named "readLock" and "writeLock" to get a "Read Lock" and "Write Lock" respectively.

And that's why, we have two more fields, one named "readLock" and the other named "writeLock".

Now, in the "increment" method, we can use the "writeLock" because we are doing a write operation. But in the "getCount" method, we can use the "readLock" to allow multiple threads to access this method simultaneously as it is a read operation.

And now, let's see the main method -
```
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    ReadWriteCounter counter = new ReadWriteCounter();

    Runnable readTask = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " read: "+ counter.getCount());
            }
        }
    };

    Runnable writeTask = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
                counter.increment();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " incremented count");
            }
        }
    };

    Thread writerThread = new Thread(writeTask);
    Thread readerThread1 = new Thread(readTask);
    Thread readerThread2 = new Thread(readTask);

    writerThread.start();
    readerThread1.start();
    readerThread2.start();

    writerThread.join();
    readerThread1.join();
    readerThread2.join();

}
```

So here, we have two "Runnable" tasks. One is named "writeTask" which will call the increment method on the counter object 10 times.

Then, we have a "readTask" which will call the "getCount" method on the counter object 10 times.

And then, we have three threads where one is a writer thread that has "writeTask" passed to it, and the other two are reader threads with "readTask" passed to them.

And then, we start them all and wait for all of them to finish executing.

Now, let's see what is the output in the terminal -
```
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-1 read: 1
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 1
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-2 read: 10
```

With a "ReadLock", multiple threads can read the shared resource simultaneously without blocking each other. This is beneficial in scenarios where read operations are common, as it increases throughput and performance.

The "WriteLock" ensures that only one thread can write to the resource at a time, preventing data inconsistencies while still allowing for high read concurrency.

And it depends on the CPU how it lets the read threads acquire the lock and execute if the writer thread is idle.

To understand this, let's update the increment method like this -
```
 public void increment() throws InterruptedException {
    writeLock.lock();
    try {
        count++;
        Thread.sleep(50);
    } finally {
        writeLock.unlock();
    }
}
```
So now, after an increment call, the Thread will sleep for 50ms. And between this time, the CPU can give a chance to other threads to execute which are the two reader threads.

And that's why the terminal will be like this -
```
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 1
Thread-1 read: 1
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 2
Thread-1 read: 2
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 3
Thread-1 read: 3
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 4
Thread-1 read: 4
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-1 read: 5
Thread-2 read: 5
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-1 read: 6
Thread-2 read: 6
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 7
Thread-1 read: 7
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 8
Thread-1 read: 8
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 9
Thread-1 read: 9
Thread-0 incremented count
Thread-2 read: 10
Thread-1 read: 10
```
Ofcourse this output will change as you re-run the code again and again because it all depends on the CPU how it executes the threads.

In summary, a thread with a "ReadLock" cannot execute while a thread holds a "WriteLock". The "ReadWriteLock" mechanism is designed to maintain data integrity by enforcing exclusive access for writes and allowing concurrent reads only when no writes are in progress. This ensures that read operations do not interfere with ongoing write operations, thereby preventing data inconsistencies.

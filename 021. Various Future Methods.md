### 1. V get() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException:
The future.get() method is used to retrieve the result of a task that was submitted to an ExecutorService. It blocks until the computation is complete and returns the result. If the computation is not yet complete, the get() method will wait until it is done.

Here's a simple example:
```
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class FutureGetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            return 42;
        };

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);

        try {
            // Blocks until the result is available
            Integer result = future.get();
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Executor: Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Task: Define a Callable task that returns an Integer after a delay.

Submit Task: Submit the task to the executor and get a Future.

Retrieve Result: Use future.get() to block and wait for the result.

Shutdown: Shutdown the executor after the task is complete.
```

### 2. future.get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit):
Using future.get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit), you can wait for a specific amount of time for the computation to complete. If the result is not ready within that time, a TimeoutException is thrown. This method is useful when you want to limit how long you wait for a task.

Example:
```
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;

public class FutureGetWithTimeoutExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate long-running task
            return 42;
        };

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);

        try {
            // Wait for up to 1 second for the result
            Integer result = future.get(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (TimeoutException e) {
            System.out.println("Task did not complete within the timeout period.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Executor: Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Task: Define a Callable task that returns an Integer after a delay.

Submit Task: Submit the task to the executor and get a Future.

Timeout: Use future.get(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS) to wait for 1 second.

Handle Exceptions: Catch TimeoutException if the task does not complete in time.

Shutdown: Shutdown the executor after the task is complete.
```


### 3. boolean isDone():
The isDone() method in the Future interface returns true if the task is completed. This includes normal completion, an exception being thrown, or the task being cancelled. It's a non-blocking way to check if the task is finished.

Example:
```
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class FutureIsDoneExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            return 42;
        };

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);

        while (!future.isDone()) {
            System.out.println("Task is still running...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Check every 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        try {
            Integer result = future.get();
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
```
Executor: Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Task: Define a Callable task that returns an Integer after a delay.

Submit Task: Submit the task to the executor and get a Future.

Check Completion: Use future.isDone() in a loop to check if the task is finished.

Retrieve Result: Once isDone() returns true, get the result using future.get().

Shutdown: Shutdown the executor after the task is complete.
```


### 4. boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);

The cancel() method in the Future interface attempts to cancel the execution of the task. If the task has not started, it will not run. If the task is already running, the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter determines whether the task should be interrupted.

Method Signature:
```
boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);
```
**Parameters:**
mayInterruptIfRunning: true if the thread executing the task should be interrupted, false otherwise.

Example:
```
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class FutureCancelExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Executing task...");
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate long-running task
            }
            return 42;
        };

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);

        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Let the task run for a bit
            if (!future.isDone()) {
                boolean cancelled = future.cancel(true);
                System.out.println("Task cancellation status: " + cancelled);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```
**What Happens Here:**
Basically, 
1. Irrespective of the mayInterruptIfRunning (true/false) if the task has not yet started , it won't start.
2. If the task has started, then this parameter (mayInterruptIfRunning) decides if we want to cancel the task or not.
```
Executor: Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads.

Task: Define a Callable task that runs for a bit.

Submit Task: Submit the task to the executor and get a Future.

Wait and Cancel: Sleep for 2 seconds, then attempt to cancel the task.

Cancellation Status: Check and print whether the cancellation was successful.

Shutdown: Shutdown the executor after the task is complete.
```

**Note : ** isCancelled() can we used to check if the task was cancelled or not.

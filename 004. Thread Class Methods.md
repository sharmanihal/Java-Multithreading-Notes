### 1. Run():
The run() method is where you place the code you want your thread to execute. 
When you start a thread by calling start(), it internally calls the run() method to begin execution. If you're creating a thread by implementing the Runnable interface or extending the Thread class, you'll override this run() method with the code you want to run in the new thread.

### 2. Start():
The start() method in Java is used to begin the execution of a new thread. 
When you call start() on a Thread object, it tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to start a new thread of execution. This new thread will then call the run() method of the Thread object.

### 3. Sleep():
The sleep() method in Java is used to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified period. 
This can be useful for simulating delays or controlling the timing of thread execution. 

### 4. Join():
The join() method in Java allows one thread to wait for another thread to complete. 
When you call join() on a thread, it pauses the execution of the calling thread(, when you call t1.join() in the main method, it means that the main thread will pause and wait for the t1 thread to finish executing before it continues with the next instructions after t1.join()) until the thread you called join() on finishes its work.

```
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate some work with sleep
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Thread has finished");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
        myThread.start();

        try {
            myThread.join(); // Main thread waits for myThread to finish
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread resumes after myThread completes");
    }
}
```

### 5. SetPriority(int priority):

This method lets us set the priorities for different threads in our application.

Before that, let's see what is the default priority if we create a new Thread.
```
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
    System.out.println(t1.getName() + " - " + t1.getPriority());
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + Thread.currentThread().getPriority());
}
```
Now, if you see the terminal, you will see that it logs -
```
Thread-0 - 5
main - 5
```
It means, by default, both the "main" thread and the "Thread-0" have the same priority of "5".

So, to give a specific prioritty to a Thread, we can use a method named "setPriority" on that Thread object. If you are wondering what is the minimum and maximum value, then the minimum value is "1" and the maximum value is "10".

This means, if you try to write -
```
t1.setPriority(20);
```
This will not show any errors in IDE but when you run the code, it will throw the "IllegalArgumentException".

The reason is that the "setPriority" method is defined like this -
```
public final void setPriority(int newPriority) {
    checkAccess();
    if (newPriority > MAX_PRIORITY || newPriority < MIN_PRIORITY) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
    if (!isVirtual()) {
        priority(newPriority);
    }
}
```
So, if the new priority value is greater than the Maximum Priority value of 10 or it is smaller than the minimum priority value of 1, then this will throw an "IllegalArgumentException".

As an absolute value, a priority is meaningless; a higher-priority thread doesn't run any faster than a lower-priority thread if it is the only thread running. Instead, a thread's priority is used to decide when to switch from one running thread to the next.

So, in our code, we can do something like -
```
    MyThread l = new MyThread();
    l.setName("LOW PRIORITY THREAD");
    l.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // 1

    MyThread m = new MyThread();
    m.setName("MEDIUM PRIORITY THREAD");
    m.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // 5

    MyThread h = new MyThread();
    h.setName("HIGH PRIORITY THREAD");
    h.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // 10
```

Keep in mind that thread priority is just a hint to the thread scheduler, and behavior might vary across different JVM implementations.


### 6. Interrupt():

The interrupt() method in Java is used to signal a thread to stop what it's doing. When you call interrupt() on a thread, it sets the thread's interrupt status to true, which can be checked by the thread and handled appropriately. For example, if a thread is in a blocking state like sleeping or waiting, it will throw an InterruptedException

The interrupt() method is super handy for managing and controlling the execution of threads. It allows you to signal a thread that it should stop what it's doing and handle the interruption, either by stopping gracefully or by performing some cleanup actions. It's particularly useful in situations where you need to:

Stop Long-Running Tasks: If a thread is performing a lengthy operation, you can interrupt it to prevent it from running indefinitely.

Handle Blocking Calls: If a thread is stuck in a blocking call like sleep() or wait(), you can interrupt it to wake it up and handle the situation.

Improve Responsiveness: By interrupting threads that aren't needed anymore, you can free up system resources and improve the responsiveness of your application.
```
@Override
public void run() {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("Thread Interrupted: "+ e);
    }
    
    System.out.println("I am running!");

}
```
And we have a main method with this -
```
MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
myThread.start();
myThread.interrupt();
```
Then, the terminal will print -
```
Thread Interrupted: java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted
I am running!
```
So, as soon as we called interrupt() method, even though the Thread was sleeping for 5 seconds, its sleep was interrupted. And while the run() method was supposed to print the text after waiting for 5 seconds, it did not do that because we interrupted its sleep so it stopped sleeping. So, the text is printed instantly after the Interrupted Exception is thrown and caught in the "catch" block.


### 7. Yield():
The yield() method in Java is a way for a thread to indicate to the thread scheduler that it is willing to pause and let other threads of the same or higher priority run. It's a hint to the scheduler that the current thread can give up its current use of the processor but is ready to run again when given the chance. However, it's just a suggestionâ€”the scheduler may or may not take it.
Let's say we have this run method -
```
@Override
public void run() {
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running!");
    }
}
```
And we create two threads -
```
MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread();
MyThread myThread2 = new MyThread();

myThread1.start();
myThread2.start();
```
If you run this code, you will see that the output is not always the same. Sometimes you might see one thread's name printed 5 times in the row, somethimes you might see only 4 instances printed and then the 5th one at the end.

But, what if we want to do something like this - print a value in first thread, then print a value in second thread and then first and then second and then so on.

So, we want this alternate printing of values. And here, we can use "yield".
```
@Override
public void run() {
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running!");
        Thread.yield();
    }
}
```
As we print a value in a thread, we will call the "yield" method which means this thread is willing to yield its current use of the processor so that the other thread can run now.


### 8. SetDaemon(Boolean on):

Daemon threads in Java are background threads that are designed to provide services to user threads. Unlike user threads, daemon threads do not prevent the JVM from exiting when all user threads are done executing.

Think of them as the "cleanup crew" working behind the scenes, ensuring everything runs smoothly without drawing too much attention. A classic example is the garbage collector. You can set a thread to be a daemon thread using the setDaemon(true) method before starting it.

Let's say we have a thread with run method like this -
```
@Override
public void run() {
    while(true) System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```
So, this will be an infinite loop because the condition is always True.

Now, if we create a new thread object and call "start" on it -
```
MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread();
myThread1.start();
```
What will happen? Of course, there will be an infinite loop.

So, JVM did not stop this execution because it is a User Thread. And as we understood, as long as there is at least one user thread, then the application will continue running. Now, what if it was a Daemon thread?

So, to make it a Daemon thread, we can use the "setDaemon" method -
```
MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread();
myThread1.setDaemon(true);
myThread1.start();
```
Now, you will see that the "Hello World" is printed just once or not even printed or maybe printed just a few times.

It is important to note that the "main" Thread is also a User Thread. And since we have written the above code in a main method, it means it is the Main Thread that runs the above lines of code. And that's why, as soon as it executes the "start()" method, "Hello World" gets printed (zero or a few times) but after that, the "main" thread gets terminated because everything in the "main" method has been executed.

Now, even though we have a new Thread named "myThread1", it is not a User Thread so now, the application has 0 User Threads which means JVM will now stop the execution of the application.

When this thread was not a Daemon Thread, the JVM did not stop the execution as this thread was a User Thread at that time.

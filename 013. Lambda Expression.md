We know that we can create a Thread in Java in two ways -

1. Extending "Thread" class
2. Implementing "Runnable" interface
And if we want to create a Thread using a class that implements the Runnable interface, we had two ways.

1. Create a new class that implement Runnable interface and then create its object and pass that object to the Thread constructor
2. Use an Anonymous Class on-the-fly
The second method is something like this -

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    };

    Thread t1 = new Thread(runnable);

    t1.start();
}
So here, instead of creating a different class that implements runnable, we are simply creating an anonymous class that implements the "Runnable" interface.

We can also write -

public static void main(String[] args) {

    Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    });

    t1.start();
}
Now, if you open the code for "Runnable" interface, you will see this -

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
So, "Runnable" is a "Functional Interface" which means it has only one abstract method in it which is the "run" method.

And when we have a functional interface, we can use "Lambda Expressions" to pass the implementation of that one abstract method.

So, we can short our code down to -

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello"));
    t1.start();
}
Here, the lambda expression is -

() -> System.out.println("Hello")
This is simply the implementation of the "run()" function. So, behind the scenes, Java will take care of everything and so, we get a cleaner code.

### Thread Lifecycle
The lifecycle of a thread in Java consists of several states, which a thread can move through during its execution.

1. New: A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started.
2. Runnable: After the start method is called, the thread becomes runnable. Itâ€™s ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
3. Running: The thread is in this state when executing.
4. Blocked/Waiting: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a resource or for another thread to perform an action.
5. Terminated: A thread is in this state after executing.

We can see the state of a Thread by the "getState()" method that is available in the Thread class.

### New State:
Suppose, we have a new Class named "MyThread" that extends the "Thread" class and overrides the "run" method. Then, when we say -

```
public static void main(String args[]){
    MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
    System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
}
```

In this case, the Thread has been created but it is not yet started. And that's why, in the terminal it will print -

```
Current State -> NEW
```


### Runnable State:
Let's call the start() method and then see the state -

```
public static void main(String args[]){
    MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
    System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
    t1.start();
    System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
}
```

Now, we see the terminal says -
```
Current State -> NEW
Current State -> RUNNABLE
```

Why it didn't print "RUNNING" since we called start()? Well, for that you have to look into how the getState() method is implemented behind the scenes. Its implementation is like this -

```
public State getState() {
    return threadState();
}
```

So, this returns a "State" type value. What is this "State"?

"State" is an Enum that has various constants defined for different states a Thread can be -

```
 public enum State {
    NEW,
    RUNNABLE,
    BLOCKED,
    WAITING,
    TIMED_WAITING,
    TERMINATED;
}
```

So, as we can see, there is no such thing as "RUNNING" in this "State" enum. So, we consider "RUNNING" as a part of "RUNNABLE" state only. So, we can say that when a Thread is in the "RUNNABLE" state, it is either running or ready to run.

We can manually print "RUNNING" in the run method (actual code that the thread is suppose to run) -

```
@Override
public void run(){
  System.out.println("Running");
}
```

And then if we see the terminal it will print -

```
Current State -> NEW
Current State -> RUNNABLE
Current State -> RUNNING
```

Now, we also saw "TIMED_WAITING" in the above enum. What's that? It means the thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.

A thread is in the timed waiting state due to calling one of the following methods with a specified positive waiting time:

```
- Thread.sleep
- Object.wait with timeout
- Thread.join with timeout
- LockSupport.parkNanos
- LockSupport.parkUntil
```

Now, note that whatever is inside "main" method, that is handled by the main thread. And we can verify that if we print the name of the thread inside the main method by doing -

```
System.out.println("CURRENT THREAD -> "+ Thread.currentThread().getName());
```

It will print -
```
CURRENT THREAD -> main
```

And this will be the case even if you have your main method inside the class that extends "Thread" class. Only the code inside "run" will be executed in a separate thread when we call "start()".

So, what if we use "Thread.sleep" in the "main" method so that we stop the execution of "main" thread for some time. Let's assume we are doing this so that we let the code in the "run" method to execute in a new thread.

Thread.sleep(100);
When you call Thread.sleep, it may cause "InterrupedException" which is a Checked Exception so you have to either surround it in "try catch" or use "throws" keyword in the method that is using "Thread.sleep".

```
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {...}
```
Now, we have paused the execution of the main thread for 100ms so the "run" method can be called now as there is time. So, let's add a delay in the "run" method as well -
```
@Override
public void run() {
    System.out.println("Current State -> RUNNING");
    try {
        Thread.sleep(2000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```
Note that here, we did not use "throws" because we are overriding the "run" method from Thread class and the "Thread" class does not have a "run" method that uses "throws". Here, we can only use "try catch".

And now, if we have a main method like this -
```
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
    System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
    t1.start();
    System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
    Thread.sleep(100);
    System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
}
```
You will see that the terminal prints -
```
Current State -> NEW
Current State -> RUNNABLE
Current State -> RUNNING
Current State -> TIMED_WAITING
```
So, here you can see that the Thread is in a "TIMED_WAITING" state due to the delay that we added.

What about the "TERMINATED" state? Well, there is a method named "t1.join()" which, when called, will wait for the Thread on which it is called to die.

That is, block the current thread until another complete.

This means, if we have -
```
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    t1.join();
    // SOME CODE
}
```
Then the main thread (the caller) will wait until the Thread "t1" finishes executing and then it will continue executing the code that is present after the line "t1.join()".

And that's why, if we say -
```
t1.join();
System.out.println("Current State -> " + t1.getState());
```
Then, it will print -
```
Current State -> TERMINATED
```
We will understand "BLOCKED" and "WAITING" states in the future.

Summary :

NEW The thread has not yet started.

RUNNABLE The thread is executing in the JVM.

BLOCKED The thread is blocked waiting for a monitor lock.

WAITING The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.

TIMED_WAITING The thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.

TERMINATED The thread has exited.

There is not just one type of "submit" method in the "ExecutorService" interface. There are actually three different types -
```
<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);
<T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);
Future<?> submit(Runnable task);
```
So, we can also pass a "Callable" type in this method and also a "Runnable" type. What is the difference between the two?

Well, if you open the definition of "Runnable", it is like this -
```
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```
And if you run open the definition of "Callable", it is like this -
```
public interface Callable<V> {
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```
Did you notice something?

Even though both interfaces have the only one abstract method (they are both functional interfaces), the "Callable" interface has a method that will "return" something. On the other hand, the "Runnable" interface has a method that does not return something.

And this is a very important difference between the two. One returns something and the other does not.

That's why, we have a question mark here -
```
Future<?> submit(Runnable task);
```
And that's why, if we want to use a "Runnable" and return something, we have to pass the result separately -
```
<T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);
```
And for this reason, when we wrote -
```
executorService.submit(() -> 42);
```
We were not passing a "Runnable" here inside "submit". Because here, the lambda expression returns a value "42". But as we know, a "Runnable" does not return something. So, in this case, we are actually passing a "Callable".

We can also write the above line as -
```
Callable<Integer> callable = new Callable<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public Integer call() throws Exception {
        return 42;
    }
};

Future<?> future = executorService.submit(callable);
```
Or we can write -
```
Callable<Integer> callable = ()  -> 42;
Future<?> future = executorService.submit(callable);
```
But, we cannot write -
```
Runnable runnable = ()  -> 42;
```
The compiler will show an error because we cannot return anything if we are using a "Runnable".

Another difference between the two is that "Callable" has a method that can throw checked exceptions. On the other hand, "Runnable" has a method that does not throw any checked exceptions.

The "Runnable" interface is typically used when we are using "Thread" class or "Executor" interface.

On the other hand, the "Callable" interface is typically used with "ExecutorService".

Now, when we use "Runnable" inside "submit" method, that does not mean we won't get a "Future" returned from this method. That will always happen. It is just that the "Future" won't have any value when we call get(). It will simply show "null" in that case.

So, we can write -
```
Runnable runnable = ()  -> System.out.println("Hello World!");
Future<?> future = executorService.submit(runnable);
System.out.println(future.get());
```
And this is a valid code.

**THE CONCLUSION**
Use Runnable when the task doesn't need to return a result or throw exceptions.

Use Callable when the task needs to return a result or might throw checked exceptions.

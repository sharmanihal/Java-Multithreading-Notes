### How to create a new Thread in Java.
To create a new thread in Java, you can either extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface.

### Method 1: extend the Thread class
A new class World is created that extends Thread.
The run method is overridden to define the code that constitutes the new thread.
start method is called to initiate the new thread.

Now, let's say we create a new object of this "NewThread" in the main method. -

```
NewThread newThread = new NewThread();
```
You might think that we need to write -

```
newThread.run();
```
But if you do this, you will see that in the terminal, it will say -

```
Current Thread - main
```
It means when we call "run" then also the code is running in the same "main" thread.
Since it is treating the run method like any other method of Java Class. 
But, we do not want that. We want the code to run in a separate thread.

And that's why, instead of "run()" we have to call "start()" -

 In Java, calling the start() method on a Thread object tells the JVM to create a new thread and execute the run() method of that Thread object on that new thread. It doesn't treat the object itself as a separate thread, but rather kicks off a new thread with the code in the run() method.

### Can we run "start()" more than once?

If you write -
```
    newThread.start();
    newThread.start();
```
There won't be any compiler warning or error. But, when you run the code, you will get an exception -

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException
```
That's because a thread can be started at most once. You cannot call the start method more than once on the same object of a class that extends "Thread".

Note that we said "same object". It means, if we have -

```
NewThread newThread1 = new NewThread();
NewThread newThread2 = new NewThread();

newThread1.start();
newThread2.start();
```

This will be a valid code and it will print -
```
Current Thread -> Thread-0
Current Thread -> Thread-1
```
So now, there are three threads in our program - "main", "Thread-0" and "Thread-1".

### Method 2: Implement the Runnable interface
A new class World is created that implements Runnable.
The run method is overridden to define the code that constitutes the new thread.
A Thread object is created by passing an instance of World.
start method is called on the Thread object to initiate the new thread.

Doesn't look like there is much difference, right?

Well, if we now go in our main class, the compiler starts showing an error where we called "start" method. Because, on a "Runnable" interface, there is no method named "start". This is just a simple Functional Interface with one method named "run".

```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}

```

So, how do we run the code in a new thread now?

Well, we have to pass this class's object that implements Runnable inside a "Thread" constructor.

### THREAD VS RUNNABLE

As we know, Java does not support multiple inheritance. It means, if there is a class that is already extending another class, then ofcourse we cannot extend "Thread" class in this case. We can only implement "Runnable" in this case.

Usually, the preferred way is to "implement" the Runnable interface. In this way, we can extend another class as well.

In Object-oriented programming, extending a class generally means, adding new functionality, and modifying or improving behaviors. If we are not making any modification on Thread then use Runnable interface instead.

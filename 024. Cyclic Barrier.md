### Understanding CyclicBarrier

A CyclicBarrier is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. It is named "cyclic" because it can be reused after the waiting threads are released.

Fixed Number of Threads: When you create a CyclicBarrier, you specify the number of threads that need to wait at the barrier before any of them can proceed.

Barrier Action: You can optionally specify a Runnable task that is executed once all threads reach the barrier.

Reusability: After all threads have reached the barrier and are released, the barrier can be reset and used again.


**Code understand CyclicBarrier:**
```
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args)  {
        int numberOfSubsystems = 4;
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfSubsystems, new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("All subsystems are up and running. System startup complete.");
            }
        });

        Thread webServerThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Web Server", 2000, barrier));
        Thread databaseThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Database", 4000, barrier));
        Thread cacheThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Cache", 3000, barrier));
        Thread messagingServiceThread = new Thread(new Subsystem("Messaging Service", 3500, barrier));

        webServerThread.start();
        databaseThread.start();
        cacheThread.start();
        messagingServiceThread.start();

    }


}

class Subsystem implements Runnable {
    private String name;
    private int initializationTime;
    private CyclicBarrier barrier;

    public Subsystem(String name, int initializationTime, CyclicBarrier barrier) {
        this.name = name;
        this.initializationTime = initializationTime;
        this.barrier = barrier;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(name + " initialization started.");
            Thread.sleep(initializationTime); // Simulate time taken to initialize
            System.out.println(name + " initialization complete.");
            barrier.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

**1. Main Class Initialization:**

The Main class is used to simulate a system startup involving multiple subsystems (e.g., Web Server, Database, Cache, Messaging Service). Each subsystem needs to be initialized before the entire system can be considered up and running.


**2. Setting Up the CyclicBarrier:**

The code creates a CyclicBarrier for four threads (numberOfSubsystems = 4). This means the barrier will wait for all four threads (subsystems) to reach the barrier before proceeding.

A Runnable task is provided as a barrier action:

new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("All subsystems are up and running. System startup complete.");
    }
}

This task will execute after all threads reach the barrier, indicating that the system startup is complete. This task is performed by the last reaching thread.



**3. Creating Subsystem Threads:**

Four Thread instances are created, each representing a different subsystem:

webServerThread, databaseThread, cacheThread, and messagingServiceThread.


Each thread is initialized with a Subsystem object.



**4. Subsystem Class Explanation:**

The Subsystem class implements the Runnable interface, allowing it to be run in a thread.

It has three attributes:

- name: The name of the subsystem (e.g., "Web Server").

- initializationTime: Time in milliseconds to simulate the initialization of the subsystem (using Thread.sleep()).

- barrier: The CyclicBarrier instance to synchronize the threads.




**5. Subsystem Initialization (run method):**

Each subsystem performs the following steps in the run() method:

- **Start Initialization:**

System.out.println(name + " initialization started.");

This prints the message indicating that the subsystem's initialization has begun.


- **Simulate Initialization Delay:**

Thread.sleep(initializationTime);

The thread sleeps for the specified initializationTime to simulate the subsystem's initialization period.


- **Complete Initialization:**

System.out.println(name + " initialization complete.");

This prints the message indicating that the subsystem's initialization is complete.


- **Wait at the Barrier:**

barrier.await();

The thread calls barrier.await(), signaling that it has reached the barrier. If all four threads reach the barrier, the barrier action (print "All subsystems are up and running. System startup complete.") is executed.


- **Starting the Threads:**

The start() method is called for each subsystem thread (webServerThread.start(), etc.), beginning their execution concurrently.




**How the Program Executes**

1. All four threads start running concurrently.

2. Each thread begins the initialization of its respective subsystem. The initialization times vary:
```
Web Server: 2000 milliseconds

Database: 4000 milliseconds

Cache: 3000 milliseconds

Messaging Service: 3500 milliseconds
```

3. Each thread waits at the barrier (barrier.await()) after completing its initialization.


4. When all four threads reach the barrier, the barrier action ("All subsystems are up and running. System startup complete.") is executed, signaling that the system is fully started.


5. The barrier then resets, allowing it to be reused in cyclic scenarios if needed.

**Summary**

The code illustrates how a CyclicBarrier can synchronize multiple threads to ensure that a group of tasks is completed before proceeding. In this case, it ensures that all subsystems are initialized before marking the system startup as complete. The CyclicBarrier allows threads to wait for each other, coordinating the completion of concurrent tasks.

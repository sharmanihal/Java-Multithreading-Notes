### ScheduledExecutorService
The ScheduledExecutorService is a specialized executor service in Java that can schedule commands to run after a given delay or periodically. It's part of the java.util.concurrent package and is designed for tasks that need to be executed at specific times or intervals.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled Tasks: Run tasks with a specified delay.

- Periodic Execution: Execute tasks at fixed rates or with fixed delays between executions.

**Example:**
```
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ScheduledExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Executing Task");

        // Schedule task to run after 5 seconds
        scheduler.schedule(task, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Schedule task to run every 3 seconds with an initial delay of 1 second
        scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 1, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Schedule task to run with a fixed delay of 3 seconds between the end of the last execution and the start of the next
        scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(task, 1, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        //we can create a scheduled shutdown as well
        scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(()->scheduler.shutdown(),20,20,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Optionally, scheduler.shutdown() could be called if you want to stop the scheduler.
    }
}
```

**What Happens Here:**
```
ScheduledExecutorService: Create a scheduled thread pool with one thread.

Single Execution: Schedule a task to run once after a 5-second delay.

Periodic Execution: Schedule a task to run every 3 seconds, with an initial delay of 1 second.

Fixed Delay Execution: Schedule a task to run with a fixed delay of 3 seconds between executions.

```

### Additional Topic : Executors.newCachedThreadPool()
Executors.newCachedThreadPool() creates a thread pool that dynamically adjusts the number of threads according to the demand. It creates new threads as needed and reuses previously constructed threads when available, which makes it ideal for short-lived, high-frequency tasks.
This is used when we have variable load of task for short period.
**Key Features:**

- **Unlimited Growth:** No limit on the number of threads that can be created.

- **Idle Thread Reuse:** Threads that have been idle for 60 seconds are terminated and removed from the pool.

- **Efficient:** Suitable for applications that execute many short-lived tasks.

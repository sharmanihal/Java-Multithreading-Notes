### Java Locks:
What happens behinds the scenes when we use the "synchronized" keyword in Java?

The thing that happens is the "Acquisition of Lock".

Every object in Java has an associated monitor lock (also called an "intrinsic" lock).

When a thread enters a synchronized method or block, it acquires the lock on the object or class (depending on whether the method/block is instance-level or static).

If another thread tries to enter the synchronized method/block, it must wait until the lock is released. While one thread holds the lock, no other thread can enter any synchronized block or method that is synchronized on the same object.

Other threads attempting to access the same synchronized section are blocked until the first thread releases the lock.

Once the thread exits the synchronized method/block (either by completing the execution or encountering an exception), it releases the lock.

At this point, one of the waiting threads (if any) can acquire the lock and enter the critical section.

### TYPES OF LOCKS
There are two types of Locks -

- Intrinsic Locks
- Explicit Locks
  
**INTRINSIC LOCKS**
These are the locks provided by the "synchronized" keyword in Java. Every object in Java has an intrinsic lock (also called a "monitor" lock), which is automatically acquired when a thread enters a synchronized block or method.

**EXPLICIT LOCKS**
These are also called "Manual" Locks. These are more advanced locks that you can control yourself using the "Lock" interface. You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more control.

Java provides the "Lock" interface in the "java.util.concurrent.locks" package, which offers more flexible and advanced synchronization mechanisms than the intrinsic locks.

### AN EXAMPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH "synchronized" KEYWORD
To understand how "synchronized" may cause issues, let's take an example. Let's say we have a "BankAccount" class -
```
public class BankAccount {

    private int balance = 100;

    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " attempting to withdraw $" + amount);
        if(balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " proceeding with withdrawal");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(10000); // SIMULATING A DATABASE CHANGE
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed withdrawal. Remaining balance is $"+ balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " insufficient balance");
        }
    }

}
```
In this class, we have a field named "balance" which has a value as "100" initially. Let's say initially the Bank Account has a balance of $100.

Now, we have a method named "withdraw" that will accept an amount which is the amount we are trying to withdraw from this Bank Account. Now, if multiple threads are going to execute this method, we want that at one time, only one thread can execute it so that we avoid any issues that can arise without synchronization.

Now, to simulate some operation on the database when we withdraw, we used "Thread.sleep" and we passed a time of 10000 ms or 10 seconds. Now, if we have two threads that execute this method -
```
    BankAccount bankAccount = new BankAccount();
    Runnable task = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            bankAccount.withdraw(50);
        }
    };

    Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread 1");
    Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread 2");

    t1.start();
    t2.start();
```
Note that here, we used an Anonymous Class to create a new Class that implements the Runnable intereface.

So, just imagine what will happen. The Thread "Thread 1" will start executing the "withdraw" method and it won't release the lock until it has executed the method. That is, either the withdrawl was successful or it was not. And while it has the lock, the Thread "Thread 2" cannot do anything.

Now, what if instead of 10 seconds, the Database operation takes 1 minute? Or 1 hour? And what if we have no timeout function for database? In that case, the Thread "Thread 1" will keep the lock on the object and so, "Thread 2" will keep waiting.

The solution is to create Explicit Locks.

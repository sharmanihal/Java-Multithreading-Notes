### Deadlock:
A deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a resource. This typically occurs when two or more threads have circular dependencies on a set of locks.

Deadlock typically occurs when four conditions are met simultaneously -

1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access a resource at a time.
2. Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.
3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them.
4. Circular Wait: A set of threads are waiting for each other in a circular chain.

### EXAMPLE
It will be easier to understand a deadlock using an example.

Suppose, we have a class "Pen" and a class "Paper" -
```
class Pen {

    public synchronized void writeWithPenAndPaper(Paper paper) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is using pen" + this+ " and trying to use "+ paper);
        paper.finishWriting();
    }

    public synchronized void finishWriting() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished using pen " + this);
    }
}

class Paper {
    public synchronized void writeWithPaperAndPen(Pen pen) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is using paper" + this+ " and trying to use " + pen);
        pen.finishWriting();
    }

    public synchronized void finishWriting() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished using paper " + this);
    }
}
```
In the "Pen" class, there is a method named "writeWithPenAndPaper" and this method takes an object of "Paper" class as argument. Then, it calls the "finishWriting" method of the "Paper" class. Also, since the "writeWithPenAndPaper" is synchronized method, it means a Thread when calls this method, it acquires a lock on the object of this "Pen" class.

Similarly, in "Paper" class also, we have a method named "writeWithPaperAndPen" and this one takes an object of "Pen" class as argument. Then, it calls the "finishWriting" method of the "Pen" class. Also, since the "writeWithPaperAndPen" is synchronized method, it means a Thread when calls this method, it acquires a lock on the object of this "Paper" class.

Then, we have two tasks (Runnable implementations) -
```
class Task1 implements Runnable {

    private final Pen pen;
    private final Paper paper;

    public Task1(Pen pen, Paper paper) {
        this.pen = pen;
        this.paper = paper;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Thread 1 locks the pen and tries to lock paper
        pen.writeWithPenAndPaper(paper);
    }
}

class Task2 implements Runnable {

    private final Pen pen;
    private final Paper paper;

    public Task2(Pen pen, Paper paper) {
        this.pen = pen;
        this.paper = paper;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Thread 2 locks the paper and tries to lock pen
        paper.writeWithPaperAndPen(pen);
    }
}
```
Both are doing the same job, except that one is using "pen" class's "writeWithPenAndPaper" method and the other is using the "paper" class's "writeWithPaperAndPen" method.

And finally, this is the main method -
```
public static void main(String[] args) {

    Pen pen = new Pen();
    Paper paper = new Paper();

    Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task1(pen, paper), "Thread 1");
    Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task2(pen, paper), "Thread 2");

    thread1.start();
    thread2.start();
}
```
Now, what will happen when we run this code?

We will see that the terminal will print -
```
Thread 1 is using penPen@63956eb and trying to use Paper@6ea85b0d
Thread 2 is using paperPaper@6ea85b0d and trying to use Pen@63956eb
```
But, the code will not stop running until we manually stop it. And here, we have a "Deadlock" Scenario.

This is what happens -
```
Thread 1 locks the "Pen" and then it attempts to Lock the "Paper"(waiting)
Thread 2 locks the "Paper" and then it attemps to Lock the "Pen" (waiting)
```
At this point:
```
Thread A is waiting for Paper, which is held by Thread B.
Thread B is waiting for Pen, which is held by Thread A.
```
This creates a circular wait condition, resulting in a deadlock where both threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release their respective locks.

### THE SOLUTION
We should always acquire locks in a consistent order across threads. For example, if you always lock "Pen" before "Paper", you can avoid circular waiting.

We know that in the "Task 2", it is calling the "writeWithPaperAndPen" method of the "Paper" class which needs an object of "Pen" class. Now, instead of first trying to acquire a lock on "Paper" class instance, it should lock the "Pen" instance first before "Paper".

So, we can write -
```
@Override
public void run() {
    synchronized (pen) {
        paper.writeWithPaperAndPen(pen);
    }
}
```
This means that the current thread will acquire the lock on the "Pen" object before executing the "writeWithPaperAndPen" method on the "Paper" object.

So, the Thread 2 will be able to lock the "Paper" instance only if it has a lock on the "Pen" object. And in this way, there will not be any deadlock.

This is because. when Thread 1 executes the "writeWithPenAndPaper" method of "Pen" class, it acquires a lock on the object of "Pen" class.

And then, in this method, it calls "finishWriting" method of "Paper" so it acquires the lock on "Paper" as well.

It is able to acquire a lock on "Paper" because "Thread 2" has no lock on "Paper" now since it needs a lock on "Pen" first. That's why, the terminal now prints -
```
Thread 1 is using penPen@1f34d709 and trying to use Paper@11f33a9f
Thread 1 finished using paper Paper@11f33a9f
Thread 2 is using paperPaper@11f33a9f and trying to use Pen@1f34d709
Thread 2 finished using pen Pen@1f34d709
```

### Issue with ExecutorService:

Consider the following example where a service is intended to perform some background work:
```
class SomeService implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
            System.out.println("Service call completed");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```
We will create three threads using an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool. In this example, we have a single service, but it could be extended to multiple services, with each thread executing its own service concurrently. Now, let's say we want the main thread to wait until all three service threads complete their tasks. The main method would look something like this:
```
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        Future<?> future1 = executorService.submit(new SomeService());
        Future<?> future2 = executorService.submit(new SomeService());
        Future<?> future3 = executorService.submit(new SomeService());

        // Ensure the main thread waits until all service threads complete their tasks
        future1.get();
        future2.get();
        future3.get();

        executorService.shutdown();
        System.out.println("All three service calls are complete. The main thread can now continue.");
    }
}
```
**In this code:**

1. We create three service threads.
2. We use the .get() method on each Future to block the main thread until all service threads complete.
3. We shut down the ExecutorService.
4. The main thread resumes after all service calls are finished.
   
### The Problem:

The issue with this approach is that if the number of service threads increases (e.g., hundreds of threads), manually calling .get() for each one becomes cumbersome and error-prone. If we forget to call .get() on any of the Future objects, the main thread won't wait for those corresponding tasks to complete, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.


### The Solution:

To address the problem, we can use a CountDownLatch. We specify the number of threads to run in parallel, which is 3 in this case. As the name suggests, the CountDownLatch counts down each thread's execution until the count reaches zero. The main thread will wait until then before proceeding.

Below is the modified code to solve the problem:
```
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        int numberOfServiceThreads = 3;
        CountDownLatch countDownLatch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfServiceThreads);
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfServiceThreads);
        Future<?> future1 = executorService.submit(new SomeService(countDownLatch));
        Future<?> future2 = executorService.submit(new SomeService(countDownLatch));
        Future<?> future3 = executorService.submit(new SomeService(countDownLatch));

        // Ensure the main thread waits until all service threads complete their tasks
        countDownLatch.await();
        executorService.shutdown();
        System.out.println("All three service calls are complete. The main thread can now continue.");
    }
}

class SomeService implements Runnable {
    private final CountDownLatch countDownLatch;

    SomeService(CountDownLatch countDownLatch) {
        this.countDownLatch = countDownLatch;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
            System.out.println("Service call completed");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            countDownLatch.countDown();
        }
    }
}
```
**Changes to the Code:**
1. Creation of a CountDownLatch Object: In the main method, a CountDownLatch is created with a parameter equal to the number of service threads to be run in parallel.
2. Passing the CountDownLatch to the Service Class: The same CountDownLatch object is passed to the constructor of the service class. In the run() method, the countDown() method is called inside a finally block to decrement the count, indicating the completion of the service call, regardless of whether an exception occurs.
3. Replacing .get() Calls with countDownLatch.await(): In the main method, instead of using multiple .get() calls, we simply call countDownLatch.await(). This ensures that the main thread waits for all three service threads to complete their tasks before proceeding.


The issue with CountDownLatch is that, it is not reusable i.e, once the count down reaches zero, there is not way for you to reuse it again for some other threads. To resolve this we can use cyclic barrier.

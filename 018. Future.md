This is how the "submit" method of the "ExecutorService" interface is defined -
```
Future<?> submit(Runnable task);
```
So, unlike the "Executor" interface's "execute" method which returns nothing, the "submit" method of the "ExecutorService" interface does return something.

This something is "Future". What is this "Future"?

Well, if you go into the definition, "Future" is an interface and it is part of the "java.util.concurrent" package.

A "Future" represents the result of an asynchronous operation.

A Future provides a mechanism to retrieve the result of a computation that may not be completed yet, allowing non-blocking operations in multi-threaded environments.

Let's see the following piece of code -
```
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> 42);
System.out.println(future.get());
executorService.shutdown();
```
So here, we used the "submit" method of the ExecutorService and then passed a "Callable" in it in the form of a lambda expression. This Callable just returns "42".

Now, this "return" value is what we can get using the "Future". Assume that this "42" was returned after three seconds. This means that before those 3 seconds, we wouldn't get anything returned back to us. "Future" is a type that we can use in this case. Whenever something is returned by this "submit" method, then that will be stored in the "Future" type.

And then, we can use the "get()" method of this "Future" to retrieve whatever was returned.

You might think what if we have some other code after the "get" method which needs what is returned and put in the Future variable. Well, in that case, that code has to wait.

That's because the get() method blocks the calling thread until the result is available or the task is done.

To see this in action, let's add some delay.
```
    Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> {
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        return 42;
    });

    System.out.println(future.get());

    System.out.println("This line will be called after we get the result of the computation!");

    executorService.shutdown();

```
If you run the above code, you will see that the terminal will not print anything for 3 seconds. And then ,it prints "42" and also the next print statement.

This shows that "get" will block the main thread until the result is available.

So, does this mean we always need to return something in our "Runnable" that we pass to "submit" method? Well, no.

We can have something like this too -
```
Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello World"));

System.out.println(future.get());
```
In this case, since nothing is returned, the "future.get()" will give us "null".

But, the benefit of this "Future" interface is that it has various methods that we can use to our advantage. For example, we might want to run some code when this computation finishes.

In that case, we have a method named "isDone()".
```
Future<?> future = executorService.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello World"));

System.out.println(future.get());

if(future.isDone()) {
    System.out.println("Task Completed!");
}
```
Note that if you call "isDone" before you call "get()" then this won't run. That's because only when we call "get()", then it will block the main thread and let the computation finish first. And only after that future will be done.

Otherwise, if we have -
```
Future<?> future = executorService.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello World"));
    
if(future.isDone()) {
    System.out.println("Task Completed!");
}
```
In this case, the main thread will run the "future.isDone" code instantly when we run the application and so, "isDone" will be false that time.

et's take a simple example of finding the "factorial" of the numbers from 1 to 9.

So, we have this simple code in our main function -
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

    for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        System.out.println("Factorial of "+ finalI + " is "+ result);
    }

    long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Time taken for finding the factorials - " + (endTime - startTime)+"ms");
}
```
Let's say that calculating a factorial of a number takes some time. So, this is how our factorial function is defined -

```
private static long factorial(int n) {

    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    long result = 1;

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

Just so that it takes some time, we have added Thread.sleep in the beginning so that everytime this method is called, there is a delay of 1 second and then the main execution happens.

So, we will see that the terminal will print the time taken as around 9 seconds.

Now, let's add in multithreading here.

We want that we have a Thread to handle the execution of the factorial method for each number so that we don't have to unnecessarily wait.

So, we can do something like this -
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

    for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        int finalI = i;
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            long result = factorial(finalI);
            System.out.println("Factorial of "+ finalI + " is "+ result);
        });
        thread.start();
    }

    long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Time taken for finding the factorials - " + (endTime - startTime)+"ms");

}
```
Note that we had to do -
```
int finalI = I;
```
Because, whenever we use a variable inside a "lambda expression" that is present outside that lambda expression, that variable has to be something whose value does not change. That is, it should be final.

That's why, the IDE will say -

The variable used in lambda expression should be final or effectively final.
The reason behind this restriction is closely related to the way lambda expressions (or anonymous classes) are implemented. Lambdas can be executed in parallel or asynchronously, which means the variable's value must remain consistent throughout the execution. If the variable were allowed to change, it could introduce race conditions or unpredictable results.

By ensuring that variables are effectively final, Java guarantees that the lambda captures a snapshot of the variable's value at the time of its creation. This is crucial because lambdas can be executed after the method in which they were defined has returned, and mutable variables may no longer exist or may have changed.

That's why we assign the current "i" to a new variable because then we know that this new variable won't be changed anywhere.

Coming back to the code, now if we run, we see that we do not get the correct output for the time taken.

Because our "print" statement that prints the time taken for calculating factorial runs as part of the main thread, it runs before the other threads even complete their execution.

What we want is to wait for all the threads to finish executing and then calculate the time.

And for that, we can keep all the threads that we create in some List and then use the "join" method on each one of them so that the main thread waits for all of them to finish.
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

    List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<>();

    for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        int finalI = i;
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            long result = factorial(finalI);
            System.out.println("Factorial of "+ finalI + " is "+ result);
        });
        threads.add(thread);
        thread.start();
    }

    for(Thread thread: threads) {
        try {
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Time taken for finding the factorials - " + (endTime - startTime)+"ms");
}
```
So here, we have a list named "threads" that will store all the new Threads we create and then, we loop over this list and call "join" on each of the threads. And so, now, we get the correct output.

It would be around 1 second.

So, we went from 9 seconds to 1 second using multithreading.

### THE PROBLEM WITH THE ABOVE CODE
The issue here is that we are doing everything here. From creating new threads to storing them in a list to waiting for them to execute to error handling. We also cannot reuse the same thread to find the factorial of some other number if it is done finding the factorial of a number.

And the solution for all this is the "Executors" framework.

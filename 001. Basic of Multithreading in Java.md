### Multithreading in Java
Java provides robust support for multithreading, allowing developers to create applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.

In Java, multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize the utilization of the CPU. Java’s multithreading capabilities are part of the java.lang package, making it easy to implement concurrent execution.

**In a single-core environment**, Java’s multithreading is managed by the JVM and the OS, which switch between threads to give the illusion of concurrency.

The threads share a single core, and time-slicing is used to manage thread execution.

**In a multi-core environment**, Java’s multithreading can take full advantage of the available cores.

The JVM can distribute threads across multiple cores, allowing true parallel execution of threads.

A thread is a lightweight process, the smallest unit of processing. Java supports multithreading through its java.lang.Thread class and the java.lang.Runnable interface.

**When a Java program starts, one thread begins running immediately, which is called the main thread. This thread is responsible for executing the main method of a program.**
